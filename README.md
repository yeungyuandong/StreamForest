## :parrot: Introduction

![introduction](demo/img/introduction.png)

StreamForest is a novel architecture designed for real-time streaming video understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike prior approaches that struggle with memory constraints or coarse spatiotemporal reasoning, StreamForest introduces two complementary innovations:

![Architecture of StreamForest](demo/img/architecture.png)

- Persistent Event Memory Forest (PEMF): A hierarchical, event-level memory system that adaptively organizes and compresses long-term video history using temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency. This ensures efficient storage without losing critical contextual information.

- Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window (FSTW): A short-term perception module that captures detailed local spatiotemporal features around the current moment, enabling precise real-time reasoning.

![ODVBench](demo/img/benchmark.png)

For effective deployment and comprehensive evaluation, we contribute:

- OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming scenarios, improving both present-moment perception and future prediction.

- ODV-Bench, a benchmark for real-time autonomous driving video understanding.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that StreamForest consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art streaming video MLLMs and achieves performance comparable to leading offline models. Even under extreme visual token compression, the model preserves nearly all of its accuracy, highlighting its robustness, efficiency, and scalability for real-world streaming video applications.

## ⚙️ Installation

- Please execute the following commands to clone the StreamForest source code to your local environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/MCG-NJU/StreamForest.git
cd StreamForest
```



- Create a new environment and install the required dependencies:
```
conda create --name StreamForest python=3.10
conda activate StreamForest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


- Search for all instances of `/your_local_path_to` within the codebase and replace them with the absolute path of the StreamForest root directory on your local machine.

## 📊 Evaluation

We employ lmms-eval for model evaluation.

#### Preparatory Steps

- Preparation of the test set JSON: Download the dataset from [StreamForest-Annodata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lanxingxuan/StreamForest-Annodata) and place it under the `./anno` directory.

- Preparation of the test set videos: Please check the `utils.py` file under each test task in `./lmms_eval/tasks`. Some tasks include a `DATA_LIST` entry, which means you’ll need to manually specify the directory where your local test videos are stored.

#### Evaluating StreamForest

- You can run the following command to evaluate StreamForest on eight benchmark datasets, including our proposed ODVBench:

```
bash scripts/eval/run_eval.sh
```

#### Evaluating Other Models

###### Predefined Models

- Execute the script `lmms_eval/scripts/eval_internvl2-8B.sh` to initiate the benchmark evaluation.

###### Custom Models

- To add a custom model, please refer to the implementation of `lmms_eval/models/streamforest.py`.

- Alternatively, you may reuse an existing model integration from [lmms_eval](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval) and adapt it to your needs. Ensure that `lmms_eval/models/__init__.py` is updated accordingly to register the new model.

*Note: Since the video data in ODVBench is associated with query timestamps, it is essential to employ `llava/video_utils.py` for proper video loading. As a reference, you may consult the implementation of the `load_video` function in `lmms_eval/models/streamforest.py`. Incorporate this function into your custom model as needed to ensure full compatibility with the lmms_eval evaluation framework.*

## ⚡ Training

#### Data Preparation

- OnlineIT-general: Download the dataset from [StreamForest-Annodata](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lanxingxuan/StreamForest-Annodata) and place it under the `./anno` directory.

- Video & Image Data: Download annotations from [VideoChat-Flash-Training-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/VideoChat-Flash-Training-Data/tree/main/annotations) and store them in the `./annotations` directory.

- Inspect all YAML files in `./anno/data_list`. For each entry, download the corresponding image or video data specified by the `data_root` field, and replace the URLs with the paths to your local data storage.

#### Training Procedure

Our training pipeline consists of five stages. The first three stages follow the setup of [VideoChat-Flash](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/VideoChat-Flash), while the fourth and fifth stages involves online video fine-tuning.

- To execute the first three stages of offline video pretraining, run
```
bash scripts/train/stage1-init_connector/s1_siglip_tome64_mlp.sh
bash scripts/train/stage2-visual_pretraining/s2_siglip_tome64_mlp.sh
bash scripts/train/stage3-video_sft/s3_siglip_tome16_mlp.sh
```


- To perform the fourth and fifth stages of online video fine-tuning, run:
```
bash scripts/train/stage4-online_ft/s4_siglip_online_dynamic_tree_memory.sh
bash scripts/train/stage5-drive_ft/s5_siglip_online_tree_memory_drive.sh
```

The table below summarizes the configuration of each stage, including the corresponding scripts, datasets, and released checkpoints.
